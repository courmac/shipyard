# shipyard
Shipyard program is a shipyard management program that allows the user to add, remove, and ship containers with a variety of options. 
Packages are entered by the user with owner, destination, and weight information. They are then assigned a container with a maximum capacity of 2000lbs each.
If a mistake is made or the package no longer needs to be shipped, the ability to remove package by ID is also given.
Packages and containers of packages can be shipped to their destinations, search for by IDs or by owner. 
Containers can be "shipped" by the user by giving the destination that they wish to ship.
Complete manifests for the shipyard or destination can be printed.
